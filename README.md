# Weather Observer System

## Overview
Professional meteorological data management system for weather observers.
Built with Next.js for scalability and maintainability.

## Current Features (0.04% of total scope)
- Weather observation data entry (Computational Page)
- Daily Register output (traditional weather log)
- METAR/SPECI formatting (aviation weather codes)
- Data persistence and retrieval

## Architecture

### Folder Structure

├── styles/           # Global styles and themes
└── utils/           # Helper functions
```

### Key Design Decisions
- **JavaScript-only** for rapid development
- **Context API** for state management (scalable to Redux if needed)
- **File-based routing** for intuitive navigation
- **Modular components** for future expansion
- **API routes** ready for database integration

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the application.

## Future Expansion Areas
- [ ] Advanced weather calculations
- [ ] Historical data analysis
- [ ] Weather forecasting integration
- [ ] Multi-station management
- [ ] Real-time data synchronization
- [ ] Advanced reporting and charts
- [ ] Mobile app integration
- [ ] API for external systems

## Development Notes
- All weather data structures follow WMO standards
- METAR/SPECI formatting complies with ICAO standards
- Database schema designed for scalability
- Authentication system ready for implementation
